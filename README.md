# Coconut Script
The home of Coconut Script.
AKA Colon Script.
Still in development, and still working on a compiler, but this is all I've made.
Coconut Script is inspired by C++ and scratch.mit.edu
# General Info
Here is some general info.
This coding language does not use parentheses. Actually the text inside of a parentheses is a comment.
It uses colons and curly brackets. Practically nothing else. Most scripts do what they're called too.
# Sample code
Here's some sample code I made: <br>

This makes a object that follows the mouse, but bounces when it reaches the corners of the screen.
